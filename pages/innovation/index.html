      <h1 class="about-description">NIT fans are excited to learn about how  thermometers work — and inspired to make them function better. Our “brain and fist” philosophy triggers real-world engagement, and thanks to NIT’s innovational record, the United States, and even other countries are filled to the brim with companies spun out of NIT. We also create lots of collaborations with the industry, as we seek interesting problems where NIT's creativity can make a change.</h1>
      <div class="container-two">
        <p>NIT’s students, faculty members and entrepreneurs have access to a remarkable list of resources — from teachers and funding to student/teacher organizations and events ­— as they are taught to drive their bright inventions into the real world market. From stick thermometers to thermometer statues, thermometer businesses or markets of every size can find creative ways to work with NIT. A range of professional organizations stand ready to help.</p>
